# Emulator

The emulator comes in two parts; a mock for the `machine` library, and a mock for the `neopixel` library. Both should be imported as shown in `main.py`.

To run the real-time visualiser:
1) `cd` into the `emulator` library.
2) If you have not already, create a virtual environment and install `pygame`. If you have, activate it.
3) Run the command `python ../main.py | python visualiser.py`
4) Sit back and watch the pretty lights!
